This is a simplified version of stefanroelofs version of Philips Hue Dimmer Switch V2.
I used stefanroelofs version as a template and:

*Ditched the "adjustible 'on' button behaviour" presets in favor for a freely custamizable 'on' button. I needed this personally for changing the behaviour of this button depending on the time of day it gets pressed.

*Kept the default, unchangeable switching-off and dimming functionality of the 'up' and 'down' buttons, but decreased the dimming steps from 25 to 10 and shortened the transition time from 1s to 0.4s to create a more refined dimming pattern, closer to the original Hue behaviour.
